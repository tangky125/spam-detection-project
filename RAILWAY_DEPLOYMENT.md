# 🚀 Railway Deployment Fix

## ✅ Files Created to Fix Railway Deployment:

1. **`.railwayignore`** - Tells Railway to ignore frontend files
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Custom Docker build for Python backend
3. **`railway.json`** - Updated to use Dockerfile builder with `/ping` health check
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies for Railway
5. **Updated `app.py`** - Background model training + `/ping` endpoint

## 🔄 Next Steps:

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - Python backend only"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Railway
- Go to your Railway dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" or the deployment will auto-trigger
- Railway should now:
  - ✅ Detect it's a Python project
  - ✅ Install Python dependencies only
  - ✅ Skip Next.js build
  - ✅ Start with `python app.py`

### 3. Test Your Deployed API
Once deployed, test with:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes:

- **Before**: Railway tried to build Next.js + Python (failed)
- **After**: Railway only deploys Python backend (success)

## 📝 For Frontend Deployment:

Deploy your frontend separately to Vercel:
1. Create a new GitHub repo with only frontend files
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Update `lib/api.ts` to use your Railway backend URL

**Your backend should now deploy successfully! 🚀**
